<p align = "justify"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and a member of <a href='https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page'>Autonomous Systems Group</a>. My research aims to build <b>socially intelligent</b> autonomous systems that co-exist, cooperate, and compete with other agents, as well as with humans. Future autonomous systems will have to reason about uncertainty to co-exist with other agents in dynamically changing environments, understand motivations to cooperate with friends more effectively, and strategically manipulate information to better compete with adversaries. To endow autonomous systems with social capabilities, I develop theoretical and computational methods by drawing from diverse fields such as control theory, online learning, formal methods, and information theory. To achieve the reliable deployment of autonomy in practice, I also test and evaluate the performance of the designed systems through numerical simulations and user studies. Some applications of my research include mobile robotics, e-commerce, and mobility-on-demand systems.</p>
